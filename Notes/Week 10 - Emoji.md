## Computational Thinking
- Thinking methodically/algorithmically 
## Correctness, Design, Style
- How we grade our solutions
## Abstraction
- Taking complicated things/ideas and simplifying them so we can solve problems
- Taking big problems and separate them into smaller ones
## Precision
- The language you use is of particular importance! Your language has to be precise
## Tools
- There are a number of ways you can engage in programming-related work outside this course.
- First, you can install command-line tools, like [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about).
- Second, you can also [learn GIT](https://youtu.be/MJUJ4wbFm_A).
- Third, you can [download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Next, you can host a website using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
- Fifth, you could host a web application via [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/), [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/), [Google Cloud Services](https://cloud.google.com/edu/students), or [GitHub’s Education Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).
